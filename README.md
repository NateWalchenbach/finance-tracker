## Project Title
     
BackPocket

## Description

With our app BackPocket, the user has the ability to log expenses for their own specific account, along with specified dates/times that correspond for that month. Through this, those expenses will fill out a monthly graph, to show you which month logged the most spending or where you could use improvement. Along with a list of expenses logged for that month. 

With the app BackPocket, a user will have the ability to track their own spending habits and in turn plan how to spend more responsibly in their future.
